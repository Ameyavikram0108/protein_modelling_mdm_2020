# Protein Modelling MDM Project

This repository contains Python modules and functions for interacting with
protein prediction data from
[BrisSynBio](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/brissynbio/). Note that a recent version
of the 'bipython' package is required to run this code.

This project is based on a 2019 project by Alex Brown, James Cass, Cheuk Ho
Chan, Imogen Taylor, and Weicheng Zhu.

## Code from the 2019 project

**protein.py**

Functions for interacting with the raw data in .pdb format. Also contains procedures
for generating random joint and protein sequences.

**representations.py**

Functions for creating simplified representations of the data.

See the following tutorial notebooks to get started.

* Exploring Representations.ipynb
* Creating New Proteins.ipynb


**distributions.py**

Functions for exploring the distributions of parameters of the representations.

 See the tutorial to get started.

* Comparing Distributions.ipynb
